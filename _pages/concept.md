# Background
The Bitcoin blockchain contains coins. New coins on the Bitcoin blockchain are created by Bitcoin miners. Users can buy the rights to coins through an exchange service. Users can transfer their rights to Bitcoin coins (or part thereof) via Bitcoin transactions. Digital wallets provide users with the ability to execute transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. Each digital wallet contains a user’s private key and is therefore a mechanism which allows users to secure their rights, as well as transfer their rights to other users via transactions. 

The Bitcoin blockchain computer code is open source (it can be legally copied and modified by a third party). Some incompatible changes to the Bitcoin software are also known as as hard forks, if they modify the rules used to validate transactions and blocks. The launch of any incompatible modifications to the Bitcoin blockchain software will cause different nodes to no longer agree on transaction history. Importantly, hard forks are deployed with a clone of the entire Bitcoin blockchain history until the validation rules were changed. The blockchain contains every historical transaction. The Bitcoin blockchain splits at the time the changed rules take effect, and from that point onwards two blockchains exist.

A user who holds rights to coins on the Bitcoin blockchain, before a blockchain split, automatically holds the identical rights to coins on the other chain after the split. 

So how do users handle these new forked coins? 

This is where chainspl.it can help 

Firstly, let’s learn a tiny bit about how Bitcoin transactions actually work. This is covered in the next section “The chainspl.it Concept”.

# The chainspl.it Concept
Your Bitcoin wallet handles spending a little differently than your wallet in the traditional sense. There are some key concepts and terminologies to grasp. Let’s start with the Bitcoin transaction. A transaction transfers your rights to coins on a single blockchain. All transactions contain at least one input. 

An input in the transaction which you are creating is an output from a previous transaction (except for in the case of mining, but that’s another story). These coin rights which you previously received can be signed by your wallet and sent to another Bitcoin user as part of a new transaction. But until you actually create and execute this transaction you have rights to Bitcoin coins in the form of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs).

As mentioned above when the Bitcoin blockchain splits, the UTXOs which you have on the original chain also exist on the newly forked chain. This is where chainspl.it comes in. chainspl.it is a service which helps users safely split UTXOs across forks. chainspl.it is non custodial, meaning all of the signing takes place on the user’s end.
